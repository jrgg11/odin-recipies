        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Use a cast iron skillet to cook <i>perfectly</i> juicy and tender chicken breasts. Make sure your skillet is <b>hot</b> and the chicken sizzles as it hits the pan to prevent sticking.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 (6-ounce) skinless boneless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
            <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed</li>
            <li>4 thyme sprigs</li>
            <li>2 rosemary sprigs</li>
            <li>lemon wedges, for serving (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all Ingredients</li>
            <li>Season chicken all over with Italian seasoning, salt, smoked paprika and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium until shimmering. Add chicken, rounded side down, and cook, undisturbed, until the bottom
                side is browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and continue to cook, undisturbed, until the other bottom side is browned, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add butter, garlic, thyme, and rosemary, and cook until butter is melted, about 1 minute. Carefully tilt pan toward you so butter pools and spoon herb butter over the top of each breast, until a thermometer inserted into the thickest portion of breast registers 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer chicken to a serving platter and let rest for 5 minutes. Serve with pan drippings and lemon wedges, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
